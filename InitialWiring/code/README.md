# Code Readme

The code here is designed to demonstrate that both the speed control servo and steering servo work as intended on our buggy. On running the code the buggy should start off, then be turned on when the console prompts you to do so for calibration purposes. After this is done once it need not be done again. Then the code demonstrates forward and reverse, followed by steering.
